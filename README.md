# VODLauncher
I got really annoyed at the fact that I forget to launh my recording software when playing games, so I made a simple console app that launches multiple apps with one click.
  
Example Usage:   
You launch the exe,  
It opens Valorant, and Medal.TV (recording software)  

How to use:
Its C# .NET console app, so feel free to build yourself to tweak save file name and what not. 

(First time running)  
Run application {you will get a msg telling you to enter a valid game path}  
Enter full path of the game .exe in "quotes" in the VODLauncher.json file (next to the VODLauncher.exe) 
Repeat for other applications that should be launched together {sperate with comma}  

From then on out, you can simply launch the VODLauncher.exe and it'll boot up both applications

Feel free to yoink this, I made this for personal use and its a super simple script
